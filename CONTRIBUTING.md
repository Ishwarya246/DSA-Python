## Help me to help you!

## Filing a bug report

* Tell me which OS you're using 
* Tell me which Python version you're using `python --version`
* Tell me which Kernel you're running: `uname -a`
* List the steps you've taken so far,
* And any solutions you've tried
* And a paste/picture of the complete output from the failing script/library would be helpful more than you think!


## Submitting a pull request

#### Do

* Do use pep8 style guidelines
* Do comment your code where necessary
* Do submit only a single example/feature per pull-request
* Do include a description of what your example is expected to do
* Do test your code before submitting a pull request under the tests/ folder

#### Don't

* Don't include any license information in your examples- our repositories are MIT licensed
* Don't try to do too much at once- submit one or two examples at a time, and be receptive to feedback
* Don't submit multiple variations of the same example, demonstrate one thing concisely

## Suggesting a feature

* Check existing issues, open and closed, to make sure it hasn't already been suggested
* Considered if it's necessary in the library, or is an advanced technique that could be separately explained in an example

### Licensing

When you submit code to our libraries, you implicitly and irrevocably agree to adopt the associated licenses. You should be able to find this in the file named `LICENSE`.

We typically use the MIT license; which permits Commercial Use, Modification, Distribution and Private use of our code, and therefore also your contributions. It also provides good compatibility with other licenses, and is intended to make re-use of our code as painless as possible for all parties.
